## ðŸš€ **Overview**

The **Election Management System Chaincode** is a blockchain-based solution built on **Hyperledger Fabric**, designed to provide a secure, transparent, and efficient framework for managing elections. This system ensures that all election activitiesâ€”such as managing candidates, voter registration, voting, and tallying resultsâ€”are handled in a decentralized and tamper-proof environment. There are 4 organizations Election Commissioner, Voter registration authority, Voting booth and Auditor.

### Key Features:

- **Election Management**:
   - declare and get election data.
- **Candidate Management**: 
  - Add, update, and remove candidates from elections.
  - Retrieve candidate information and their vote counts.
  
- **Voter Management**: 
  - Register voters and check their eligibility.
  - Maintain and retrieve voter records.

- **Voting Process**: 
  - Securely cast and record votes.
  - Ensure each vote is counted accurately without duplication.

- **Election Results**: 
  - Automatically tally votes and declare winners at the end of the election.
  - Provide transparency and verifiability of election results.

The system ensures **data integrity** and **transparency** by utilizing **Hyperledger Fabric**â€™s blockchain features, making it ideal for applications requiring verifiable, tamper-resistant data.

By leveraging **chaincode** and **CouchDB** for advanced queries, this system offers a robust, scalable solution for elections, guaranteeing fair and secure management of election processes.
